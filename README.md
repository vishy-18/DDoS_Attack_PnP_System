# 🚀 DDoS Attack Detection System

![DDoS Detection Banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/DDoS-Detection-green)

## 💡 Overview

This project implements a **Machine Learning-based DDoS Attack Detection System** to classify network traffic as **normal or under DDoS attack**. It uses Python, pandas, and scikit-learn for data preprocessing, training, and detection.

📊 Key Features
✅ Detects DDoS attacks vs normal traffic
✅ Uses Random Forest classifier for high accuracy
✅ Modular code with separate scripts for clean pipeline
✅ Easily extendable to real-time detection using Scapy or sockets
✅ Clear, beginner-friendly implementation and explanations

🔬 Dataset
Format: timestamp, src_ip, dst_ip, packet_size, protocol, label

Label: 0 for normal, 1 for DDoS attack
(Replace dataset.csv with your chosen dataset such as CICIDS or KDD Cup.)
